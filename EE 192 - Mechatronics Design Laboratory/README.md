EE 192. Mechatronic Design Laboratory
University of California - Berkeley

The hardware is composed of:

1 7.2V battery, which is the main and only source of the car.
1 Hamamatsu optical sensor, which is used as a speed sensor.
1 LED, which, in combination of a reflective surface, works as input for the Hamamatsu sensor.
1 Line sensing camera, used for tracking the position of the track line.
1 KL25Z microprocessor, where resides all software and processing power of our system.
1 Servomotor, used to steer the front wheels.
2 DC motors, which gives the car its mechanical energy.
4 NDP7060 transistors, used to transfer energy to the back wheels or to stop them.
1 MAXIM (max620cpn) voltage booster, which increases the battery voltage to 12V.
1 LM2940CT voltage regulator, which regulates the voltage of the car circuitry to 5V.
1 Switch, which is used as an emergency switch to stop the motor current.

The circuit also incorporates several wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes.
